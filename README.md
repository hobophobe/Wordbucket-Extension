This is the WordBucket add-on.  It is experimental.

Known problems:

1. Index is not restricted by tab.
2. (Maybe fixed) Old page words may persist after location change.
3. Console logging of a lot of debug info.
4. Some errors caused by entity references (eg, &nbsp;).
5. Possibly need to expand blacklisted elements (buildindex.js).
