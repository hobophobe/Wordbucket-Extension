This is the WordBucket add-on.  It is experimental.

Known problems:

1. Pages loaded from BFCache (back/forward cache) retain the last-loaded page's index.
2. Console logging of a lot of debug info.
3. [Maybe fixed] Some errors caused by entity references (eg, &nbsp;).
4. Possibly need to expand blacklisted elements (buildindex.js).
